# QuickFigures
QuickFigures is a toolset for creating scientific figures see publication for details


Note from the author: 
You have permission to use any part of the QuickFigures project and share it with 
colleagues. I don't expect much more than recognition and thanks. 
It is primarily for academic use by researchers at scientific institutions. In the event
that it takes off with incredible popularity, I might need to start making many improvements and
possibly start asking for help. 
Furthermore, I would be flattered if parts of my work were re-used or repurposed by others.
Some of the source code does not follow ordinary conventions for naming and explanations 
for how my code works are not always detailed. Feel free to reach out for me 

Please feel free to contact me with anybug reports, questions, recommendations or comments.

Enjoy the toolset,
Gregory
